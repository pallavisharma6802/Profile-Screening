### AI-Powered Resume Screening Tool

Developed a resume screening tool using BERT for semantic analysis and deep learning. The tool processes resumes to generate text embeddings and compute similarity scores against predefined categories like Project Management, Data Analytics, and Healthcare. It visualizes these scores with pie charts and shortlists top candidates based on aggregate scores. Implemented a Tkinter-based GUI to display the shortlisted candidates. The solution leverages Python libraries including transformers, torch, pandas, and matplotlib for NLP, scoring, and visualization.

*Tech Stack:  Python, transformers, torch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, PyPDF2, tkinter, BERT.*
