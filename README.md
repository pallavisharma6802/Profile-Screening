### AI-Powered Resume Screening Tool

Developed an AI-driven resume screening tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including pre-trained language models like BERT for semantic analysis. Combined with classification algorithms such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to enhance candidate shortlisting accuracy. Integrated visual data representation with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and provided a Tkinter-based graphical interface for user interaction.
